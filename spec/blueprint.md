## Critical Implementation Rules

1. **Map Interaction**: Never allow user interaction (no zoom, pan, or click on map)
2. **Clickable Elements**: Only stage dots in Processing Pipeline panel
3. **Sequential Completion**: Stages must be completed in order - cannot skip ahead
4. **Coordinate Precision**: All coordinates exactly as specified - no rounding
5. **Animation Timing**: Every timing exactly as specified in milliseconds
6. **No Scrolling**: Interface never scrolls under any circumstances
7. **Global Lock**: Use isAnimating flag to prevent overlapping animations

## Animation Timing Specifications

- **Camera movements**: ease-in-out
- **Path drawing**: linear
- **Marker appearances**: ease-out
- **Color transitions**: linear
- **Scale animations**: ease-in-out
