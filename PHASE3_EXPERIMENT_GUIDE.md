**Base**: Phase 2 Complete (92/100 health score)

---

## 🎯 **EXPERIMENTAL SETUP COMPLETE** ✅

### **What's Been Done:**
1. ✅ **Committed Phase 2** - All stable code saved to main branch
2. ✅ **Created experimental branch** - `phase3-database-experiments`
3. ✅ **Safe environment** - Can experiment without breaking main

### **Current Status:**
```
main branch: ✅ STABLE (Phase 2 complete)
experimental branch: 🧪 READY FOR PHASE 3 EXPERIMENTS
```

## 🚀 **HOW TO USE THIS BRANCH**

### **For Safe Experimentation:**
```bash
# You're already on the experimental branch
git status  # Should show: "On branch phase3-database-experiments"

# Make your changes here
# Test database integration
# Break things safely
# Learn and iterate
```

### **To Switch Back to Stable:**
```bash
git checkout main  # Back to stable Phase 2
```

### **To Save Good Experiments:**
```bash
# After successful experiments
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Working database integration"
git push origin phase3-database-experiments
```

### **To Merge Back to Main:**
```bash
# Only when Phase 3 is complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge phase3-database-experiments
```

Phase 3 is complete when:
- [ ] Database schema working
- [ ] API routes functional
- [ ] Frontend connected to real data
- [ ] WebSocket events working
- [ ] No breaking changes to UI/UX
- [ ] All tests passing

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW**

```
1. Experiment on this branch
2. Test thoroughly
3. Fix issues
4. When stable → merge to main
5. Continue to Phase 4
```
